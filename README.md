# Rails Template

> **NOTE:**  This is a work in progress. 

#### Idea:

The idea is to have rails templates to make it easy to start a new project with your preffered settings.
Avoid adding required gems manually when you can use a template and have them added while generating the project.

- rspec
- devise
- pre-commit
- overcommit
- graphql
- react
